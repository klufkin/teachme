echo -e 'git checkout'

# the command's description
echo "The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

git checkout works hand-in-hand with git branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a branch with git branch, then check it out with git checkout. You can work on multiple features in a single repository by switching between them with git checkout."
