echo -e 'git rebase'

# the command's description
echo "Rebasing is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit. Rebasing involves moving a branch from one commit to another. Internally, Git accomplishes this by creating new commits(replacing the commits from the branch being moved) and applying them to the specified baseâ€” literally rewriting the project history.

The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history and is a common way to integrate upstream changes into your local repository."
